title: Upgrading the home-network
---
Our home-network has been running on an Edgerouter Lite (now discontinued) for 8 years or so and it worked just fine. But, during the summer the heat in our garage has been exceeding 30C/86F degrees and it gave up on me. Now it peeps like a little bird when I turn it on.
